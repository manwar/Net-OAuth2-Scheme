This archive contains the distribution Net-OAuth2-Scheme,
version 0.010001_001:

  Token scheme definition framework for OAuth 2.0

This is a token/token-scheme description framework to be shared
amongst clients, authorization servers, and resource servers.  It
specifies the transport/formatting/encoding and the secret-sharing
protocol -- basically everything you need in order to be able to
create, use, and validate tokens, i.e., beyond what's actually 
spelled out in the OAuth2 spec itself.

Build/install in the usual way

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

See Net::OAuth2::Scheme and Net::OAuth2::Scheme::Factory
for actual documentation.
